This wiki is for cataloging collection items and adding background information. Thus 
there a two page types

1. Collection Item pages
2. Normal pages, without collection item information

Across both kinds of pages, page names need to be unique. This is needed for the wiki so
you can embed references to other pages (or pages to be created) in square brackets \\[thus\\].
Please be careful not to change page names.


Page content is also written using non-Markdown directives inside square brackets.

Page content is written in a formatting language called Markdown. 

## Using square brackets

- \[existing page name\] to create a link to another page.
- \[new page name\] for a new page.

Put links to other pages on the web in text:
