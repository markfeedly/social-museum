##Introduction

This special purpose wiki provides a virtual museum with collection items and additional information. The ocntent of the museum is intended to be crowdsourced. The wiki provides various facilities to aid in that process.

You can read this wiki, navigating through it, without signing in.

To contribute to the content and comment on content, you need to sign in. If you don't have an account yet you need to sign up for one, confirm your e-mail address via an e-mail that we send you, and then sign in. It's an easy process.

For the moment, your sign up registration needs to be approved by an administrator. As we improve spam detection, the need for this will probably disappear. 

##Collection items
 
Collection Item pages, these are distinguished by having a item number (item in the collection) and a location (which assumes items in the collection are physical objects, stored or displayed somewhere). Ignore the location if that is nor relevant.

## More information

There may be pages of information that are not specifically about collection items. These pages may provide background information about the collection and collection items. E.g. biographical details about someone pertinent to the collection.

## Using page and collection item titles as hyperlinks

Within page and collection item content, you may create hyperlinks to pages and hyperlinks. When a user clicks on a hyperlink s/he is taken to the referenced page.

Across both kinds of pages, page names need to be unique. This is needed for the wiki so
you can embed references to other pages (or pages to be created) in square brackets 

- \[A page or collection item title\]

## Hyperlinks

When you are editing a page, please be aware that if you change the page name, you will break any  links to the page that appear on other pages.

Page content may augmented by making other uses of square brackets
written using non-Markdown directives inside square brackets.

Page content is written in a formatting language called Markdown. 

## Using square brackets

Put links to wiki pages in text:

- \[existing page name\] to create a link to another page.
- \[new page name\] for a new page.

Put links to other pages on the web in text:

- \[url optional-display-text\] to to create a link to create a new page.

For images, YouTube videos, or Vimeo videos the following should be on lines by themselves

- \[url-for-image optional-width\]
- \[url-for-youtube-video optional-width\]
- \[url-for-vimeo-video optional-width\]

Titles, for successive levels start the line with # ## or ###

List item starts with * or - with blank lines above and below the list.

A quote starts with > with blank lines above and below list thus

> Quote text

Replicate this for successive quoted paragraphs.
