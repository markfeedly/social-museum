Day three of Gonnie's 80s Classics Challenge, and I can't get out of 1983 (yet). Today, remixes of the day's classic choice and the usual rejects section.

1983 Indeep - Last Night A DJ saved my life
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtfZbj4J71A
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1QPdXNiN-0

Seminal tune from 83. I remember being out and hearing a remix, contemporary electro on the dark side of things, genius.
"What was that remix?"
"I'll just look on the disc." DJ pulls out a CD or DVD with, uh, something helpful like 'top tunes' on it.
Anyway I tracked it down in some obscure Webby place, but can I find it again on the Web or on a computer passim? Where
I was making it longer on the general "can't have too much of  a good thing " principle. Is that missing drive where the VERY IMPORTANT document I'm searching for is? Oh no, I see booting all 'dead' machines in my near future.

Anyway, turns out there are loads of remixes, 400 or so. Beatport is your home from home here.

And if you play them all you are a sick puppy. I wimped out on even flicking through them after a page and a bit. The Stomebridge remix is good, first two minutes at

Alternately the remix and dance off vid at will almost certainly amuse you.

So, onto rejects for today, all somewhat related in my past listening pleasure, roll in

1983 Indeep - The Record Keeps Spinning
A good year for Indeep; this is a close contender for the Indeep slot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0-69Av9a0E

1983 The Gap Band - Just Be Good To Me
Another tune inextricably linked to the 1983 in my life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khj9jyNvhpQ

1980 The Gap Band - Burn Rubber On Me
The version which starts with the car burning rubber sound...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1cpSJtIqM

In the hunt for some electro I accidentally skipped over this with my 1983 post yesterday

1982 Tyrone Brunson - The Smurf
Electro. And what a fab instrumental. Con this vid title says this tune came out in 82.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXGHpzgnCpg

1983 Hashim - Al Naafiysh (The Soul)
On an electro compilation I made when I thought burning a CD might be the way to go after the era of mix tapes. Anyway gave a bunch of these outto mates for Xmas sometime in the noughties, eliciting from one friend 'We putut it on and thought what the fuck is this. But by the end we were dancing round our bedroom.' Al Naafiysh is the last tune on the CD. Nuff said.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i46sF1PcqL8

Ok, I've listened to too much electro in the last few days and I'm electro'd out for now... but see ya tomoz pop pickers.

=====================

Day four of Gonnie's 80s Classics Challenge, and I'm going to jump from the rich pickings in 1983 to 1986. Should make for a good pre-86 rejects section.

1986 Phillip Glass - Changing Opinion, off Liquid Days
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68-ThG8D_jg&list=RD68-ThG8D_jg#t=14

Had this for ages, return to it once in a while; love the cyclic piano and the Roache sisters' vocals.

Of course Phillip Glass is lurking elsewhere in the 80s, with soundtracks for Koyaanisqatsi (82) and Powaqqatsi (88).

And, of course, Laurie Anderson is pretty much Glass-like her 81 O Superman; I was led from her to him a couple of days ago.

1981 Lawrie Anderson - O Superman (For Massenet)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vkfpi2H8tOE
More about the song, including some Bowie stuff I haven't bothered to chase up
https://bowiesongs.wordpress.com/2013/09/12/o-superman/
Little spiel on the making
https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/apr/19/how-we-made-laurie-anderson-o-superman

----

Some of several 83-85 rejects

1983 Soul Sonic Force - Planet Rock
Arther Baker alert. I've always had some minor ambivalence about this track, but it's rocking despite imho being nownere near the next tune in greatnesss.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDCYjb8RHk

1983 New Order - Blue Monday
I'm not a big fan of New Order, but sometimes they kill it. This is one example. Could easily be a classic in this list.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYH8DsU2WCk

1983 Lime - On the Grid
I dont know what toe-staring sub-genre this is.
And unfortunately atypical for Lime; they never did anything like it again.
This surfaced in the Hac, maybe it was Mike Pickering playing it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am1c-bbKEP4
Or the Morales dub version, also on youtube
http://www.beardodisco.com/beatelectric/music/lime_on_the_grid_dub_version.mp3

1983 Barbara Mason - Another Man
Ha ha, Barbara Mason steals someone else's husband only to find he's not all he seems.
When I first heard it I thought it was a novelty tune, but it has grown considerably with me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBpgT6a6d7I

1984 Jocelyn Browne - Somebody Else's Guy
Seems infidelity was gunning it in 83-84... The 12 inch version is a notably-bouncy discofunk number, celebratory in parts of its instrumental rendition; a happiness inducer. Which is a strange contrast to the lyrical content. But hey, ruminations aside, its a great tune.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdC2jPPxAwk
Here's a different version, preseumably the original, definitely worth a watch. And in contrast with the twelve this version both sad and angstful. Which just goes to show you can't trust a dance remix when it comes to rendering emotions. Great vid here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdGNeC2G1AU

1985 James Brown - Living in America
Smooth funk, James Brown's paen to America, again a great vid.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5BL4RNFr58

Ok, onto day five tomorrow.

==========

Day five of Gonnie's 80s Classics Challenge, and it's certainly carrying on being time-wise challenging to write these; check the URL-rick rejects sections in all these posts.

In date order I know day six will be from 1998, so today we have a wide field of house to choose from. I'm going to ignore the obvious beat

off between, from 86, Steve 'Silk' Hurley's minimalist Jack your Body and Farley 'Jackmaster' Funk's hypnotic House Nation.
The former reached a number 1 in the UK -- quite mysteriously to me at the time, cause what is it about this tune that has propelled it to that slot,
surely the public etc etc. Actually it was quite polarising, I remember a friend's wife sounding off about it "I don't want to hear 'jack me till I ...' ".
The latter, only heard by me later, is also a true 80s classic (IMHO, your milage ma be different).

But I'm turn to an 97 tune, Nitro Deluxe's This Brutal House. Possibly because it sounds quite old school electro-ish to me,
and, yes, still turns me on each time I hear it.

1987 Nitro Deluxe ‎– This Brutal House
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMYw38H3FuE

Loads of good stuff in the rejects section, probably the longest yet....

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6MemGg4jr4

And how did these get away unlisted earlier?

1982 Raw Silk ‎– Do It To The Music
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqGcGIOPsNg

1982 Marvin Gaye ‎– Sexual Healing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjlSiASsUIs

=============



1998 Abdulliah Ibrahim - Blues for a Hip Hop King


-----------

Such luck for Gonnie's date-ordered 80s Classics Challenge: Comuter love in 81 to kick things off, and Promised Land in 89 to finish with on day seven.

 1989 Joe Smooth - Promised Land
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxl4-zR1Pk4

 " Sisters, Bothers / One Day we will be free. / From Fighting, Violence, People Crying in the Streets. /
 When the angels from above / Fall down and spread their wings like doves. / As we walk, hand and hand, / Sisters, brothers
 We'll make it to the promised land. "

 What can I say? It played out one night a week foever at the Hacienda. Mixed emotions: End-of-night
 = bad even if there is a plan or a plan to be made. But
 there's Joe Smooth again, how truly upliftingly beautiful, there couldn't a better tune to play right now.
 And it's stood up to the ravages of time, it still has the ability to get me emotional.

 So is this it, the long-fabled harder-to-find-than-the-holy-grail best-tune-ever? It would be naïeve to say this, but perhaps. For me,
 in the 80s, This could be knocked off the perch by 808 State's Pacific State, again from the same year.

 Contenders and rejects...

 1988 Inner City - Big Fun
 My mate's big fave; at the time I could see what he liked but it didn't deeply ring my bell. since then I've warmed more to it. Waving hands vid alert.
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omfiVkkJ1OU
 Here's 2014 update, complete with a feminists-look-away-now bricolage video, but hey dancin women, yes
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XSAgfV9a_8

 1988 Inner City - Good Life
 After a 'what the hell, may as well throw this in as well', I recall that this is the Inner City tune that I always did and still do. Haven't played it for a while, but an enjoyable rediscovery.
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJxJxr9RlKM

 1989 Imagination - Just An Illusion (remix)
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bsoYDjOnU0
 This shorter 89 version with a vid I've never seen before
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkYgnsGrQlw
 And this charmingly impertfect-vocals version, with live vocals over a backing track
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAw9Fx5R1-w

 1989 Frankie Knuckles & Jamie Principle - Your Love
 Unless heard in a club at club volumes, for me at least this tune is more an intellectual pleasure, much like listening to some repetating Bach harpsichord piece.
 And what a etc.
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8HdqPej-Ps


 1989 808 State - Pacific State
 Well, well, well how strange to find you here.... I read that I heard you for six months in the Hac pre-release. I remember you there, but more from the 90s, where you were a big fave with me, natch.
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmMuwuC1RuM
 All the remixes are here, tip: Quadrastate
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmMuwuC1RuM

 N.W.A. ‎– Straight Outta Compton
 Gangsta rap. Glorify that violence.
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMZi25Pq3T8

 N.W.A. - Fuck tha Police
 I read that ater being repeatedly told by local city police not to play it at each gig, they decided in Detroit that as its what everyone
 wants to hear, let's play it. And on doing that, when the band saw poice starting to climb on stage they did a runner. Heh. Though they didn't get paid for the show.
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M8vei3L0L8

 1989 Fingers Inc - Can You Feel It
 Fat bass line coupled with a 'just relax now everythings alright just like its always gonna be' synth.
 Larry Heard aka Mr Fingers aka Fingers Inc always went down well.
 Originally an instrumental in 86 Washing Machine, this version has an acappella from Rhythm Controll's 87 My House ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NSn5RfxoXs ) mixed into it.
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dEee7IDuhw
 Oh, sorry you want the version with Martin Luther King in it?
 http://www.nicozon.net/player.html?video_id=sm6565347

 1989 A Guy Called Gerald - Voodoo Ray
 Big in the Hac, I think I was there when it was first played, pre-release. Whatever, when I first heard it there it blew my mind... A strong conteder for this slot
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emDEFtJIjy0


 1989 Frankie Knuckles - Your Love
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOLE1YE_oFQ
 Ha ha, trainspotters corner, just noticed this; listen to the 90s Candi Staton bootleg. No wonder I like the bootleg.
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3PoymGSEs


 1989 Public Enemy - Fight the Power
 Classic this version has the higher res vid on you tube. Watch it. Tune clicks in half way through or so.
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7t8eoA_1jQ

 1989 Frankie Knuckles Presents Jamie Principle ‎– Your Love
 Knucles veneer over an already fine tune, mention earlier in some reject list.
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8HdqPej-Ps

 ----

 And in the how did this get away earlier section

 Kariya ‎– Let Me Love You For Tonight
 I suspect I first heard this bein played by Sasha a birthday party in the cresents, before he went on to greater things.
 With, interalia, fantastastic vocals, this is perhaps slipping down my list of all time greats, but nonetheless still very much holds its own.
