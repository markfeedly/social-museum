Day three of Gonnie's 80s Classics Challenge, and I can't get out of 1983 (yet). Today, remixes of the day's classic choice and the usual rejects section.

1983 Indeep - Last Night A DJ saved my life
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtfZbj4J71A
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1QPdXNiN-0

Seminal tune from 83. I remember being out and hearing a remix, contemporary electro on the dark side of things, genius.
"What was that remix?"
"I'll just look on the disc." DJ pulls out a CD or DVD with, uh, something helpful like 'top tunes' on it.
Anyway I tracked it down in some obscure Webby place, but can I find it again on the Web or on a computer passim? Where
I was making it longer on the general "can't have too much of  a good thing " principle. Is that missing drive where the VERY IMPORTANT document I'm searching for is? Oh no, I see booting all 'dead' machines in my near future.

Anyway, turns out there are loads of remixes, 400 or so. Beatport is your home from home here.

And if you play them all you are a sick puppy. I wimped out on even flicking through them after a page and a bit. The Stomebridge remix is good, first two minutes at

Alternately the remix and dance off vid at will almost certainly amuse you.

So, onto rejects for today, all somewhat related in my past listening pleasure, roll in

1983 Indeep - The Record Keeps Spinning
A good year for Indeep; this is a close contender for the Indeep slot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0-69Av9a0E

1983 The Gap Band - Just Be Good To Me
Another tune inextricably linked to the 1983 in my life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khj9jyNvhpQ

1980 The Gap Band - Burn Rubber On Me
The version which starts with the car burning rubber sound...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb1cpSJtIqM

In the hunt for some electro I accidentally skipped over this with my 1983 post yesterday

1982 Tyrone Brunson - The Smurf
Electro. And what a fab instrumental. Con this vid title says this tune came out in 82.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXGHpzgnCpg

1983 Hashim - Al Naafiysh (The Soul)
On an electro compilation I made when I thought burning a CD might be the way to go after the era of mix tapes. Anyway gave a bunch of these outto mates for Xmas sometime in the noughties, eliciting from one friend 'We putut it on and thought what the fuck is this. But by the end we were dancing round our bedroom.' Al Naafiysh is the last tune on the CD. Nuff said.

Ok, I've listened to too much electro in the last few days and I'm electro'd out for now... but see ya tomoz pop pickers.

=====================

Day four of Gonnie's 80s Classics Challenge, and I'm going to jump from the rich pickings in 1983 to 1986. Should make for a good pre-86 rejects section.

1986 Phillip Glass - Changing Opinion, off Liquid Days
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68-ThG8D_jg&list=RD68-ThG8D_jg#t=14

Had this for ages, return to it once in a while; love the cyclic piano and the Roache sisters' vocals.

Of course Phillip Glass is lurking elsewhere in the 80s, with soundtracks for Koyaanisqatsi (82) and Powaqqatsi (88).

And, of course, Laurie Anderson is pretty much Glass-like her 81 O Superman; I was led from her to him a couple of days ago.

1981 Lawrie Anderson - O Superman (For Massenet)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vkfpi2H8tOE
More about the song, including some Bowie stuff I haven't bothered to chase up
https://bowiesongs.wordpress.com/2013/09/12/o-superman/
Little spiel on the making

Some of several 83-85 rejects

1983 Soul Sonic Force - Planet Rock
Arther Baker alert. I've always had some minor ambivalence about this track, but it's rocking despite imho being nownere near the next tune in greatnesss.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lDCYjb8RHk

1983 New Order - Blue Monday
I'm not a big fan of New Order, but sometimes they kill it. This is one example. Could easily be a classic in this list.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYH8DsU2WCk

1983 Lime - On the Grid
I dont know what toe-staring sub-genre this is.
And unfortunately atypical for Lime; they never did anything like it again.
This surfaced in the Hac, maybe it was Mike Pickering playing it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am1c-bbKEP4
Or the Morales dub version, also on youtube
http://www.beardodisco.com/beatelectric/music/lime_on_the_grid_dub_version.mp3

1983 Barbara Mason - Another Man
Ha ha, Barbara Mason steals someone else's husband only to find he's not all he seems.
When I first heard it I thought it was a novelty tune, but it has grown considerably with me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBpgT6a6d7I

1984 Jocelyn Browne - Somebody Else's Guy
Seems infidelity was gunning it in 83-84... The 12 inch version is a notably-bouncy discofunk number, celebratory in parts of its instrumental rendition; a happiness inducer. Which is a strange contrast to the lyrical content. But hey, ruminations aside, its a great tune.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdC2jPPxAwk
Here's a different version, preseumably the original, definitely worth a watch. And in contrast with the twelve this version both sad and angstful. Which just goes to show you can't trust a dance remix when it comes to rendering emotions. Great vid here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdGNeC2G1AU

1985 James Brown - Living in America
Smooth funk, James Brown's paen to America, again a great vid.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5BL4RNFr58

Ok, onto day five tomorrow.

==========

Day five of Gonnie's 80s Classics Challenge, and, wow, is it challenging time-wise to write these. But I always wanted to
be able to look at a record in a record bin and hear the tune in my head, and I have found with this exercise
that while digging around on the interwebs for detail about records is an interesting exercise, sometimes one can approach
(but only approach) that 'look at record and hear it' thing.

OK so slit five is kinda wide open to up to something from xxx for classic six. And its about time in the decase for some house to get mentioned. And I really can't choose.

First a precursor to the house thing, almost-pardoxically also in the mainstream charts. I include it because its a fave of mine from that time.

Now the house, and I think that without exception I only got to hear all of these later than when published.
